üö©When working with your data in SAP Analytics Cloud, you may find that you want to look at additional components to your data that are currently not captured by the existing measures and dimensions in the model. Luckily, story designers can extend the data models with additional calculated measures and dimensions. This enables the story creator to delve into further insights from their data. Let us start by creating a calculated dimension that divides the Store dimension in our data into Studios and Non-Studios. 

13. Click **Gross Margin % for Actual** Chart

‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to Calculated Dimensions!  
  
Calculated Dimensions are useful when you want to enrich your dimension if your model does not have the needed format. 
 
You can choose to combine existing dimensions to create your own dimensions. There are two calculated dimensions that can be created: 
  
**Calculated Dimension:** Use formulas to create new dimension members 
  
**Measure Based Dimension:** Use ranges within an existing measure to determine how to group 
dimension members together 

![8-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141006683-1dac0f5e-40f5-42b1-9448-84903c584235.png)

üö©As we want to identify the stores that are studios, we will use the regular calculated dimension. 

17. Click **Calculated DImension**

![8-16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141006684-629e5566-31ab-4431-afcd-6fc004c70b94.png)

üö©The formula field for Calculated Dimensions uses conditional logic and function formulas to create the Dimension rules. This offers the business analyst great flexibility in defining new calculated dimensions. 

18. Press **Ctrl + Space** on the Keyboard

![8-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141006687-22d5b394-0876-4870-a982-91d0838a5f94.png)

19. Click IF

üö©Our IF statement has three fields. The first field is used as a condition that evaluates to true or false. The second field is the Dimension value if True and the third field is the Dimension value if False. 

![8-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141006690-43289132-1d4a-4003-9185-c48ed9272b85.png)

‚ÑπÔ∏èWelcome to String Functions in the Calculation Editor! There are a variety of different String Functions that can be used to transform the Dimension values to a specific use case. 
  
**FINDINDEX:** Search for a substring and return its 0 based index 
**ENDSWITH:** Returns True if given string ends with user given substring 
**TRIM:** Removes unwanted leading and trailing spaces 
**REPLACE:** Replace characters in a string with a specified replacement 
**SPLIT:** Returns substring from a string using a specified divider 
**UPPERCASE/LOWERCASE:** Convert a string to all Lower or all Upper case 
**CONCAT:** Combine two strings together 
**LEFT/RIGHT:** Returns the specified number of characters from the beginning or end of a string 
  
Let us use RIGHT function to categorize Stores by if they are a Studio. 

22. Scroll till **RIGHT** is **Visible**

23. Click **RIGHT**

![8-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141006695-8a2018bd-3e34-455f-a47c-e8fd45b3c6dd.png)

üö©We know we are trying to divide our Store dimension into Studios and Non-Studio. Since we are looking for "Studio" at the end of store name, we know we should filter on 6 characters using our RIGHT string function. 

29. Type **"6"** in the **Second Input Field** for the **RIGHT** Function

![8-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/141006700-9275c240-e159-478e-b613-2334cb849a77.png)

üö©Let us compare the last 6 letters of our store name with Studio to group them into two Store Groups. 

30. Type in =**"Studio"** following the RIGHT formula

31. Type in **"Studio"** in the **TRUE** Field for the IF Function

32. Type in **"Non-Studio"** in the **FALSE** Field for the  IF Function

## Exercise 2.2 Create a Variance within a Story

Objective: Up to this point, we have created a lot of visualizations. For us to easily draw conclusions and highlight key insights, we should add variances and thresholds on our charts in our dashboard so we can draw attention to changes and outliers. 

Estimated Time: 5 mins

Exercise Description: You as a Dashboard Designer will be able to create previuos period comparisons for being able to highlight the charts with critical points.

Key Features:

Define variances in our charts


![3-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261811-ccb46f24-2b2e-44cd-bc9f-65e5babceb12.png)

üö©First, let us add a variance to our KPI for average sales revenue in stores so we can compare if average sales revenue has dropped this year relative to our previous year's performance. If you can recall, our KPIs currently have a 2021 time filter applied on them. 

1. Right Click on the Avg Sales Revenue Chart to Open the Context Menu

2. Click Compare To

3. Click Previous Period

üö©We want to compare our data in 2021 year to date with the calculation for the previous year. By comparing to previous period, SAC will automatically calculate this variance for us. 

![3-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261815-181434bd-67c1-4f37-b97e-b6319df2c378.png)

üö©After creating our variance, the absolute value may still be hard to contextually understand. We want to know the percentage difference so let us edit this variance. 

![3-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261816-7eaefbe5-59b2-4fe0-b0ae-aa4dd3d848a3.png)

4. Click **1 Variance**

5. Click **Edit All Measures in Use**

![3-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261817-c5304eab-976e-4c15-b1dc-fcd2913ff093.png)

üö©In this panel, users can choose how they want to format their variances to best fit their data. We are comparing a KPI across two periods using a single number. In this instance, a percentage would be easier to understand for an end user. 

6. Click **Percentage**

7. Deselect **Numbers**

8. Click on **Avg Sales Revenue for Actual** to Collapse the Variance Panel

![3-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261818-9c84e36a-6eeb-45ff-a5db-4a508521d031.png)

üö©The new variance looks great! We can now clearly see that average sales revenue in our stores has experienced a 3.7% drop from the last period. 

![3-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261820-4d487ce7-79be-4bd8-ab9a-53445779ee16.png)

üö©Now let‚Äôs add more variances to our chart. A good candidate to track change in data over time is our chart using a time dimension. SAC offers recommended comparisons in the builder panel as a suggestion for easy creation of variances. 

9. Select your **Gross Margin per Order Date for Actual** Chart

üö©We want to select Previous Period because it will dynamically change the variance based on the granularity in the chart. 

10. Expand **Recommened Comparisons**

11. Click **Previous Period**

![3-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261821-154f9835-dac8-4f7a-9d40-d52f19f718a8.png)

üö©Our variances show the delta to the period before, in this case the last month's gross margin. We want to know the percentage difference instead of absolute difference. Let us change the formatting of our variance values. 

![3-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261822-434fb259-be1f-43b8-8ddf-a193366b87f5.png)

‚ö†Ô∏èQuality check! Have your variances in the chart updated to percentage values? Please note your data will look different due to the dynamic time filter on the chart

![3-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92877810/138261825-3b5fffe4-a935-4968-b6ff-e73fe5248003.png)



## Exercise 2.3 Create a threshold

Objective: Welcome to the Thresholds panel. 

Estimated Time: 5 mins

Exercise Description: You as a Dashboard Designer will be able to create Within Thresholds, you can create a threshold based on a number range or against another measure. In our case, we are interested in a number range.

Key Features:
