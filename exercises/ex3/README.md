16. Set the Widget width for each widget to 25 so other widgets in the lane also occupy the same width when added.
    <img width="1666" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-DA161/assets/146448346/42553867-33cb-41e7-8fec-49039ed91df4">

18. You can also the do the same for a Large Phone scenario, where Each Widget is already defined with a responsive rule to occupy the full screen width.
    <img width="1664" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-DA161/assets/146448346/cf7b38e7-e875-48a6-b334-e3ed437febba">

You can scroll down on the phone screen to check the presense of the other designed widgets being displayed sequentially and full screen width.

🚩We will now see how to hide a widget when consuming over mobile devices

19. Table is not a great use case of mobile screens so let's try to hide it for small phones.
    <img width="1661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-DA161/assets/146448346/b0eb2c4f-a1cd-4393-9e0d-3545dcecbbf5">

20. Select Lane in which we see the table, in our case it is Lane_3, Open the Builder panel with the button to enable the right panel.
    <img width="1663" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-DA161/assets/146448346/94202fe2-af96-48ff-908b-f07328eda9ef">

21. You can now set the widget visibility for Table widget and say hide the widget by adding it from the list
