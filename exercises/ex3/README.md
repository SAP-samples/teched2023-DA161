üö©Let's group few widgets into this lane, 

3. Move "Gross Margin per Sales Manager" and "Gross Margin per Product, Workout Usage"
  <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img3.png)<br><br><br>

  <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img9.png)<br><br><br>

8. Choose Widget Position as Free, which means widgets can be freely moved and stay in a specific position, irrespective of others and device types.
  <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img10.png)<br><br><br>

11. Now change the device to small tablet
   <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img14.png)<br><br><br>

The responsive rules cascade down from larger to smaller devices. As there is no rule defined for small tablet, it now follows the one just defined for large tablet.

12. To overide and define a different rule for small tablet, switch on _Activate_.

   <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img15.png)<br><br><br>

    
13. For small tablet, you'd like to display the charts in an auto type of layout, choose _Auto-Flow_ , which means the widgets will be placed sequentiually.

  <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img19.png)<br><br><br>

17. Choose the right panel button to close it.
   <br>![](/exercises/ex3/Images/33img20.png)<br><br><br>
